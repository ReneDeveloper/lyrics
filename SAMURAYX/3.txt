Kimi ga namida ni yureru toki
Dousureba iin darou
Sora wo miagetemo
Kokoro ga itai

Kizu tsukanakute ii koto ni
Dare mo ga fureteshimau

Mizu no tsumetasa ni
Odoroku 
toki no you ni

Tonari ni iru dake de
Nanimo dekinai kedo
Arittake no egao 
kimi dake ni kakaete okuruyo 
donna toki mo

When you did nothing but weep,
I was also at a loss.
I looked up at the sky
and my heart was in pain.
When you are uninjured
You can be hit at anytime by anyone.
It is the same surprise as when
Touching cold water.
I'm only next to you
And I can't do anything, but
For you only I'll make a present of
All the happiness in my smiling face,
Carrying you anytime.

Shinjite ii yo yume wa yattekuru
Kimi no tame dake ni
Naitemo ii yo donna kanashimimo
Tsubasa ni kawaru no sa sono mune de

You can believe your dreams are coming
Just for you.
You can cry because you can make any sadness
Into wings in your heart.

Dareka wo mamoru koto nante
Kantan ni dekinai ne
Kimi ni furuame mo
Tomerarenai yo

Dakedo akirametaku wa nai
Chippokena yuuki demo
Itsuka honto no
Tsuyosa ni nareru naraba
Chiisana chou de sae
Umi wo koeteyukeru
"Itsuka, kitto" sonna kotoba shika
Ienai jibun ga kuyashii kedo

Protecting someone
Is not an easy thing to do, is it?
I can't stop the rain
From falling on your head either.
Even with only a little courage--
I don't want to give up.
Someday, if I become used to my
Real strength...
Even a small butterfly
Can cross an ocean.
"Someday, for sure," is all I can tell you,
But that frustrates me.

Shinjite ii yo niji wa yattekuru
Kimi no tsuma saki e
Shinjite ii yo kimi no toki ga kuru
Mousugu atarashii kaze no naka

You should believe a rainbow is coming
To the tips of your toes.
You should believe your time will come,
Soon, in the middle of a new breeze.

Sou sa kanarazu yume wa yattekuru
Sono mune wo hiroge
Kitto namida wa sore wo shitte iru
Oshie ni kitan dayo 
ashita kara

So yes, a dream is definitely coming--
Spread open that heart.
Your tears knew that, without a doubt.
I think they came from tomorrow to tell you.

Shinjite iiyo yume wa yatte kuru
Kimi no tame dake ni
Naite mo iiyo donna kanashimimo
Tsubasa ni kawaru no sa sono mune de

You can believe your dreams are coming
Just for you.
You can cry because you can make any sadness
Into wings in your heart.
